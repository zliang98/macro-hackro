# Installation
Navigate to the Releases Tab of the Github Repository and download the ZIP file corresponding to the operating system that you are using. BARCODE has been tested on macOS and Windows, and has apps for both operating system.

Otherwise, if you are on Linux, or would like to be able to edit the source code, you can clone this repository and edit the source files directly. To install the required packages, you can use PIP to install them using the following command: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. Keep in mind that this code was developed in Python 3.12 -- versions of Python prior to 3.12 may not be able to run this program from the source code.
# Usage
## Data Preparation
Currently, BARCODE only takes in TIFF and ND2 file formats. If files you wish to process are not in either format, you will need to convert them to a TIFF file using ImageJ/FIJI.

Additionally, due to the development of BARCODE as a high throughput classification program, BARCODE only takes input files of 5 GB or less. If the file is any larger, it is recommended that you crop your video and run that through the program.

## Running BARCODE
Click on the app file (or the executable if on Windows). From there, a window will appear with the user interface. The user inputs are described below. When finished specifying the operational settings, click "Run" to begin the BARCODE program.

## Output Files
The BARCODE program can save multiple outputs.
- **Summary:** At the base level, the BARCODE program outputs the 
- **Summary Barcode:** The BARCODE program can also output a visual representation of the data metrics described in the Summary file above. This is done by normalizing the metric values using default limits, and then plotted using the Matplotlib color map "Plasma". These visualizations are separated by channel for ease of visualization.
- **Summary Graphs:** The program can also output graphs for visualization of the analysis performed by the modules. The resilience module provides a graph plotting the change in void size over the video, while the coarsening module provides a histogram of the pixel intensities of the specified frames, as well as a plot of the difference between the first and final frames. The flow module outputs up to 3 flow fields, representing the first, middle, and last flow fields computed with optical flow.
- **Intermediate Data Structures:** The program will also output the intermediate data structures used to perform the analysis. This would be the binarized frames of the video for the resilience module, the flow fields for the flow module, and the intensity distributions for the coarsening module. All three of these are saved in CSV file format, and are comparatively small, with the largest files being at most 1-10 MB.
All file outputs are saved in a folder titled ```{name of file} BARCODE Output``` , saved in the same folder as the file. The summary and barcode are saved in the root folder where the program is running.
